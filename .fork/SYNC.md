# Upstream sync manifest

This repository is a personal fork of [MorpheApp/morphe-patches](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches).
It has **no shared git history** with upstream (it was created from a tree copy), so syncing is done by
**overlaying the new upstream tree and re-applying the fork delta**, not by `git merge`.

This file is the authoritative procedure. It is written for an automated agent session; a human can follow
it too.

## State markers (update on every sync)

- **Upstream baseline:** `dev @ 59eb43f7e1e3c30406665f193ef7bc5e79122851` (2026-07-13, v1.35.0-dev.3)
- **Last synced upstream release:** none yet (fork baseline is ahead of upstream stable v1.34.0)

## What is fork-local

### 1. The delta patch — `.fork/upstream-delta.patch`

17 files, re-applied onto each new upstream tree. Semantics (for manual re-application when the
patch no longer applies cleanly):

**Feature: Hide brainrot comments (YouTube)**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `extensions/youtube/.../patches/components/BrainrotDetector.java` | **New file.** De-obfuscating meme-lexicon density scorer. |
| `extensions/youtube/.../patches/components/BrainrotCommentFilter.java` | **New file.** `Filter` subclass; path callbacks on `comment_thread.eml` (expanded list) + `comments_entry_point_teaser`/`comments_entry_point_simplebox` (collapsed preview); calls `detector.shouldHideAnySegment(asciiStrings.getStrings())` (per-segment, to avoid buffer-noise dilution); gated by `Settings.HIDE_BRAINROT_COMMENTS`. |
| `extensions/youtube/src/test/.../components/BrainrotDetectorSelfTest.java` | **New file.** Plain-javac self-test; must print `27 passed, 0 failed`. |
| `extensions/youtube/.../settings/Settings.java` | Add `HIDE_BRAINROT_COMMENTS = new BooleanSetting("morphe_hide_brainrot_comments", TRUE)` next to the other comment settings. (Also carries the Cat lock setting below.) |
| `patches/.../youtube/layout/hide/general/HideLayoutComponentsPatch.kt` | (a) const `BRAINROT_COMMENT_FILTER` = extension class descriptor; (b) `SwitchPreference("morphe_hide_brainrot_comments", summary = true)` in the `morphe_comments_screen` preference screen; (c) `addLithoFilter(BRAINROT_COMMENT_FILTER)` next to the other `addLithoFilter` calls. |
| `patches/src/main/resources/addresources/values/youtube/strings.xml` | Add `morphe_hide_brainrot_comments_*` and `morphe_cat_lock_button_*` strings. |

**Feature: Cat lock (YouTube)** — a player button that locks the screen (transparent full-window overlay swallowing all touches) so a pet can watch; unlocked by the alternating-opposite-sides tap gesture.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `extensions/youtube/.../patches/catlock/AlternatingTapUnlock.java` | **New file.** Pure unlock-gesture recognizer (alternating L/R fast taps). |
| `extensions/youtube/.../patches/catlock/CatLockOverlay.java` | **New file.** Full-window transparent overlay on the Activity decor view; consumes touches; unlock via `AlternatingTapUnlock`; keep-screen-on + fading hint. |
| `extensions/youtube/.../videoplayer/CatLockButton.java` | **New file.** Top player-control button (mirrors `ExternalDownloadButton`); `onClick` calls `CatLockOverlay.engage(view)`; gated by `Settings.CAT_LOCK_BUTTON`. |
| `extensions/youtube/src/test/.../catlock/AlternatingTapUnlockSelfTest.java` | **New file.** Plain-javac self-test; must print `11 passed, 0 failed`. |
| `patches/.../youtube/interaction/catlock/CatLockPatch.kt` | **New file.** Mirrors `DownloadsPatch`: `SwitchPreference("morphe_cat_lock_button")`, `copyResources("catlock", ...)`, `addTopControl("catlock", ...)`, `initializeTopControl`/`injectVisibilityCheckCall(CatLockButton)`. |
| `extensions/youtube/.../settings/Settings.java` | Add `CAT_LOCK_BUTTON = new BooleanSetting("morphe_cat_lock_button", FALSE, true)` among the overlay buttons. (Same file as brainrot above.) |
| `patches/src/main/resources/catlock/host/layout/youtube_controls_layout.xml` | **New file.** Top-controls button, anchored `toStartOf @id/morphe_external_download_button`. |
| `patches/src/main/resources/catlock/drawable/morphe_yt_cat_lock_button{,_bold}.xml` | **New files.** Cat-face vector icon. |
| `extensions/youtube/.../swipecontrols/SwipeControlsHostActivity.kt` | In `dispatchTouchEvent`, short-circuit swipe controls while `CatLockOverlay.isLocked()` (swipe controls act at the Activity level, ahead of the overlay view, so brightness/volume swipes must be suppressed while locked). Import `CatLockOverlay`. |

**Fork infrastructure (not tied to a feature)**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `patches/build.gradle.kts` | `group = "app.variablenine"`; personalized `about {}` block (name "variablenine Patches", fork notice, source URL). |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Add `issues: write` and `pull-requests: write` to job permissions. |
| `.github/workflows/open_pull_request.yml` | Add workflow-level `permissions: contents: read, pull-requests: write`. |

### 2. Fork-owned files — restore after overlay (never take upstream's version)

- `README.md` (personal-fork README; the `PATCHES_START/END` section is regenerated by release.yml)
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `gradle.properties`, `patches-list.json`, `patches-bundle.json` (owned by THIS repo's semantic-release)
- `.fork/**` (this manifest and the delta patch)
- **Deleted:** `patches-bundle.png` (Morphe logo; must stay deleted — GPLv3 §7 branding restriction)
- **Deleted:** `.github/workflows/crowdin_pull.yml` and `.github/workflows/crowdin_push.yml` (upstream translation-sync jobs that require Morphe's Crowdin secrets; in this fork they only fail and email the owner — keep them deleted on every sync)

## Sync procedure

1. Clone upstream: `git clone https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches.git` (plain git over HTTPS —
   do NOT use GitHub API tools on the upstream repo; this session's GitHub tooling is scoped to the fork).
2. Determine the latest **stable** tag `vX.Y.Z` (semver tags, no prerelease suffix). Decide staleness in
   the UPSTREAM clone: sync only if the baseline/last-synced commit above is an **ancestor** of the tag's
   commit. If the tag is an ancestor of the marker (older than what we ship), stop — nothing to do.
3. In the fork, branch from `dev`. Remove all tracked files except fork-owned ones, copy in the upstream
   tree at the tag (exclude its `.git`), restore fork-owned files (`git checkout` them back), keep
   `patches-bundle.png` deleted.
4. Apply the delta: `git apply -3 .fork/upstream-delta.patch`; on failure `git apply --reject` and repair
   the `.rej` hunks manually using the semantics table above (upstream may have refactored the touched
   files). **Regenerate `.fork/upstream-delta.patch`** against the new tree afterwards so the next sync
   starts clean.
5. Verify locally: run the `BrainrotDetectorSelfTest` with plain `javac`/`java` (must be 22/22).
6. Update the state markers in this file. Commit everything as
   `bump: Sync upstream Morphe patches vX.Y.Z` (the `bump:` type produces a patch release), push to `dev`.
7. CI is the compatibility gate: the `Build pull request` workflow must compile the bundle
   (`./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid`). If it fails, diagnose and fix; do not proceed while red.
8. When CI is green: mark the auto-opened `dev → main` PR ready and **merge it (merge commit, never
   squash)**. The Release workflow on `main` then publishes the new bundle automatically.
9. If the delta cannot be re-applied confidently or CI cannot be made green, STOP: leave the `dev → main`
   PR as draft with a comment explaining exactly what upstream changed and where the sync is stuck.

## Hard rules

- **Stable only.** Only ever sync to an upstream **stable** release: a semver tag `vX.Y.Z` with
  no suffix. NEVER sync to a `-dev`, `-rc`, `-beta`, `-alpha`, or any other prerelease tag, and
  never to an untagged `dev`-branch commit. (The initial fork baseline `v1.35.0-dev.3` is the one
  historical exception — from the first sync onward the baseline must always be a stable tag.)
- Never force-push `main` or rewrite semantic-release commits/tags.
- Never reintroduce Morphe branding (logo files, "Morphe" as the bundle name).
- `chore:` commits do not trigger releases; use `bump:` for syncs so a release is cut.
